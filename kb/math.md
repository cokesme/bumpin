# Math
Things useful for thinking about signals and waveforms.
Deriving sinusodial waves and thinking about how things are offset
- unit circle, r=1 , x, y like a normal circle (this is also useful when thinking about period)
- rad to degree is a proportional relationship so think about
- if you know sin you can derive everything else using pythagorean theorem
